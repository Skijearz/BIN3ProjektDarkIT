# DarkIT
Project I used to make during the 3rd semester of my applied computer science study.

Its a simple 2D puzzler which is a homage to the SNES game "Goof Troop" from 1993.

Utilizes JavaFX for rendering the Windows and [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) to create the worlds using the sprites.
The Tiled jar, is a self modified version to load ressources from within the jar instead of a external ressource.
